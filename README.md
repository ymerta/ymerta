# 👋 Hi, I'm Yakup Mert Akan

🎓 AI-focused Software Engineer | 💡 Machine Learning & LLM Enthusiast | 🌍 Lifelong Learner  

I'm a software engineer based in Ankara, Turkey. I graduated from TED University with a degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Applied Data Analytics. Currently, I'm working as an **AI Engineering Intern at Netmera**, where I develop chatbot solutions and AI-powered automation for internal departments such as **Customer Success and Marketing**.

I'm passionate about building smart, scalable systems using **Python, ML/DL frameworks, and cloud-native tools**. I also work on web apps using **React, Firebase, and Tailwind** — especially for projects involving dashboards, monitoring systems, and data-driven applications.
